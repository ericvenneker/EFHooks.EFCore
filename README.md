# EFHooks.EFCore
A port/conversion from  Atrejoe / EFHooks to help migration to .Net Standard 2.0 and EF Core 3.1

You can use this library to slowly move your existing code from .NET Framework 4 to .NET Core 3/.NET 5

If you need to keep working with EF Classic, you can go to https://github.com/ericvenneker/EFHooks. That library contains a .NET Standard 2.1 version with EF Classic 6.3.
